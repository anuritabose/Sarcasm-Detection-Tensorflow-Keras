# Sarcasm Detection using Tensorflow and Keras, a ML Approach


For this Natural Language Processing project, my team has decided upon using Tenserflow, an open source framework for Machine Learning, as the backend for our project “Sarcasm Detection using Emojis”. 

We are also using Keras, a high-level Python neural networks library, as a wrapper to Tenserflow. 

Using Tenserflow, we are building a natural language processing system to detect sarcasm in text, in the form of Twitter tweets, Reddit comments, or Facebook data.
